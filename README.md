# RandSeed

RandSeed is a custom (and unoptimized) psuedo-random number generator. It takes a human-entered seed and will hopefully generate a large random seed using it combined with some irational numbers.

The file under the name of "random-data-set.txt" is Set #1, A random set of numbers containing an equal amount of each number, created by yours truly.
